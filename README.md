# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Text Classifier
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a text classifier to sort movie reviews into positive and negative reviews using a naive Bayesian model. Using a set of reviews which have already been tagged as either positive or negative, words are assigned frequency values for how often they appear in either type of review. The model is then trained using these frequency values to generate a loglikelihood and logprior for each word. Once trained the model can be applied to reviews whose sentiment has not been categorized to predict whether they are positive or negative.
